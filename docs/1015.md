title: "Parameter cannot have question mark and initializer."

If a parameter is marked as optional with `?`, it means that passing `undefined`
is acceptable. If a parameter is marked as optional by providing an initializer,
it communicates to readers that if not provided (or set to `undefined`) the
default will be used. It doesn't make sense to use both modifiers.

```ts
function test(a?: number = 0) {}
```
